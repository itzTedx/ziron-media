<Header title="CRM">
  A CRM integration connects your CRM software to another program, allowing data
  to flow in one or both directions between them. It boosts productivity by
  automating workflows and providing you and your team with a single platform
  that has all of the data (and often much of the functionality) from both
  platforms.
  <br />
  The necessity to go back and forth between the two connected systems may be
  fully eliminated with a CRM integration.Data may flow one way or in both
  directions so that one tool automatically syncs with the other when you take
  actions using either one of them. In some cases, it even allows for users to
  access some or all of the functionality of both platforms from either
  platform.
