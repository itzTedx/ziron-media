title: Branding
description: After more than a decade of building branding solutions for our clients, we’ve learned a simple truth. Not all brands are created equal. There is a believe, an underlying force that guides successful brands and makes them stand apart. It’s why we created our Brand believe philosophy. We help your brand stand for something bigger by uncovering the believe that you hold dear and using it as a compass to guide everything you do.

  “You never get a second chance to make a great first impression.” 
  
  We have all  heard that saying before, and it couldn’t be truer when applied to your Branding and corporate identity.
  
  Branding is the craft that connects the mission, vision, and purpose of the brand with its customer. Branding is at the core of everything we do. Every
design, every detail, every decision — all purposefully crafted to strengthen our clients’ brands.

<AboutCard title="Branding">
  We build brands that cannot be ignored. This is our bread and butter (and
  sometimes our tea). Whether it’s launching a new brand or reinvigorating an
  old one, we‘ve perfected the craft. Building bold, resonant, stunning brands
  is what we’ve been doing for 4+ years. 
  
  And although our branding clients range
  from tiny start-ups to global brands, our recipe for success is fundamentally
  the same. It’s a highly collaborative process that begins with some intense
  introspection and discovery, explores strategic and creative options, and
  culminates with the launch (or relaunch) of an authentic brand that simply
  cannot be ignored.

## How we achieve your goals

1. #### Discovery

Depending on the nature of a project, the kick-off meeting may be followed by any combination of the following: stakeholder interviews, questionnaires, market research, competitive analysis, and content strategy. In all cases, a creative brief is drafted and approved.

2. #### Research

Market research isn’t on the menu for every project. But when budget and time permit, we’ll engage our research partners, who offer a variety of research methods. The insights gained from this effort provide guidance, expedite consensus, and confirm that we’re making the right decisions.

3. #### Positioning

With a clear understanding of the company’s purpose and vision, the messaging and positioning framework is developed. This internal document, refined over multiple review rounds, will serve as the strategic foundation of the brand. It will unify all messaging around a single tone and voice.

4. #### Design

With the foundation in place, we move into the visual expression of the emerging brand identity. We begin by exploring and presenting multiple design solutions. Once a direction has been selected, it is refined over a series of creative review rounds, then finalized for application and launch.

5. #### Guidelines

Once complete, the new brand identity is codified in a style guide. This document provides guidance on the correct and consistent application of the new brand assets. Our brand guides are almost exclusively digitally produced, enabling us and our clients to constantly update and expand the guide.

6. #### Launch

A new brand identity will thrive externally only if it is first adopted internally. So we work with our clients to develop both internal and external launch tactics, including the build out of new business forms, signage, and sales and marketing assets. And our partnership doesn’t end there.
